## My solution:
- Create a pre-hook to set up environment, table, roles, tags, masking policies, etc.    
- Add the table created in the pre-hook as a source.  
- Alter the table to set a tag in each of the relevant columns.  
- Alter the tags to set a masking policy for each.  
- Create 3 tables querying the table as...  
  - role_01,  
  - role_02,  
  - regular role not present in masking policy  
- Create a final table showing the union of the 3 tables above, as well as the role used to query them (using roles for each table & thread may be a bit cumbersome)

STORY
It’s not just bad guys that need to guard their secrets!
Superheroes are our first line of defence against those evil-doers so we really need to protect their information.
Running a superhero organisation however is a big job so we’ve got a lot of people that have access to our systems and we need to make sure that the true identity of our heroes is never revealed!
HR is advocating for a more personal touch to our business though and has requested that some staff should be able to see the first names of the superheroes to connect on a more basic level. Higher ups should still be able to see everything !

CHALLENGE

With the use of Tags and Masking , we want to mask the first_name and last_name columns from our data_to_be_masked table.
We want the following :

The default user that has access can only see the hero_name data unmasked
Role foo1 can only see hero_name and first_name
Role foo2 can see the contents of the whole table
