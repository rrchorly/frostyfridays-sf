## My solution:
- Use the macro from week 1 to create a new stage.  
- Retrieve the file as json,
flatten on house and flatten on monarch.  

I tried to be creative to extract the distinct keys inside the 'Monarchs' json for the different rows.  
It was a learning experience using object_keys, array_agg, and array_to_string but, eventually, a rabbit hole.

- so I ended up with something like  
  
```  
with temp as (
    select * from { _{ ref('challenge_04_01') }_ })
select 
    row_number() over (order by temp.monarchs['Birth'] asc ) as id,
    temp.monarch_index+1 as inter_house_id,
    temp.era,
    temp.house_name,
    temp.monarchs['Name']::varchar as NAME,
    temp.monarchs['Start of Reign']::date as START_OF_REIGN,
    regexp_replace(temp.monarchs['Age at Time of Death']::varchar,'[^0-9]','')::number
     as AGE_AT_TIME_OF_DEATH_YEARS,
    temp.monarchs['Birth']::date as BIRTH,
    temp.monarchs['Burial Place']::varchar as BURIAL_PLACE,
    coalesce(temp.monarchs:"Consort\/Queen Consort"[0]::varchar,temp.monarchs:"Consort\/Queen Consort"::varchar) as CONSORT__QUEEN_CONSORT_1,
    temp.monarchs:"Consort\/Queen Consort"[1]::varchar as CONSORT__QUEEN_CONSORT_2,
    temp.monarchs:"Consort\/Queen Consort"[2]::varchar as CONSORT__QUEEN_CONSORT_3,
    temp.monarchs['Death']::varchar as DEATH,
    temp.monarchs['Duration']::varchar as DURATION,
    temp.monarchs['End of Reign']::date as END_OF_REIGN,
    coalesce(temp.monarchs['Nickname'][0]::varchar,temp.monarchs['Nickname']::varchar) as NICKNAME_1,
    temp.monarchs['Nickname'][1]::varchar as NICKNAME_2,
    temp.monarchs['Nickname'][2]::varchar as NICKNAME_3,
    temp.monarchs['Place of Birth']::varchar as PLACE_OF_BIRTH,
    temp.monarchs['Place of Death']::varchar as PLACE_OF_DEATH
from temp
```
the `coalesce` before the arrays is useful when the json is a string (i.e. there was only one spouse/nickname).  


## the prompt
Frosty Friday Consultants has been hired by the University of Frost’s history department; they want data on monarchs in their data warehouse for analysis. Your job is to take the JSON file located [here](https://frostyfridaychallenges.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/challenge_4/Spanish_Monarchs.json), ingest it into the data warehouse, and parse it into a table that looks like this:  


- Separate columns for nicknames and consorts 1 – 3, many will be null.  
- An ID in chronological order (birth).  
- An Inter-House ID in order as they appear in the file.  
- There should be 26 rows at the end.  

### Result:

Your result should look like:
